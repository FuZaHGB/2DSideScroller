A neat little 2D Platformer implemented with olcConsoleGameEngine using the windows CMD window as its display.

This was my first foray into both C++ and Game programming and was completed by following Javid9's 'Simple Tile Based Platform Game', which can be found on YouTube.

Many thanks to Javid for his excellent tutorial and engine, I've gained a much greater understanding of both Game Logic and C++. My Maths has also improved with this, however there are still parts of this code I don't understand :P
